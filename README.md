# tic-tac-toe
My take on a vanilla JS Tic-Tac-Toe game

Instead of letting the script create the gameboard, I decided to do this myself, since there are only nine squares. 
The game of Tic Tac Toe is rather simple.To win, try to get three marks into a row, column or diagonal before 
the opponent does.

I used the DOM Node List to create an array from my nine squares and manually created an array of
winning scenarios.
Furthermore I tried to implement more Module patterns than I did before - which was basically the assignment also.

After I accomplished the PvP logic and added a 'Game Over' PopUp, I decided to create a Human vs Computer mode.
At the time of writing this the in-game AI lacks the 'I' part massively. It's just a random number that doesn't 
take into account any Minmax concepts. 

# UPDATE

I changed the color palette and added a feature that lets users enter their name. Will try to get
the AI functionality up and running in a few days - hopefully.
